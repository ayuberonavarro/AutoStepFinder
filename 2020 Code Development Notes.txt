-line 1058, 1073: outcommented xlim, ylim in user plots as it may crash code
	(such as trace: testdata_simulated_BleachTrace20steps);
	left code there for possible later improvement
-note: disable the 'try/catch' commands to trace source of crashes (such as ~line91)
-cleaned test directories

1) Made 'StepMaker
It allows a wide range of trace types to be generated from sampling simulated step size distributions. It saves a trace as text file for feeding into the AutoStepfinder.  Each run provides a unique curve.

2) Expanded the comment section with some case studies,  these clarify how one can quickly construct simple test traces of varying nature. 

3) Made 'BleachTraceMaker''; to be added to StepMaker
