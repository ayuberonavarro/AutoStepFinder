SUMMARY
Single-molecule techniques allow the visualization of the molecular dynamics of nucleic acids and proteins with high spatio-temporal resolution, for example a motor protein stepping along DNA. Valuable kinetic information of biomolecules can be obtained when the discrete states within single-molecule time trajectories are determined. Here we present a fast, automated, and bias-free step-detection method, AutoStepfinder, that we developed to determine steps in large datasets without requiring prior knowledge on the noise contributions, distribution, and location of steps. The analysis is based on a series of partition events that minimize the difference between the data and the fit. A dual-pass strategy determines the optimal fit and allows AutoStepfinder to detect steps of a wide variety of sizes. We demonstrate successful step detection for a broad variety of experimental traces. The user-friendly interface and the automated detection of AutoStepfinder provides a robust analysis procedure that enables anyone without programming knowledge to generate step fits and informative plots in less than an hour.
